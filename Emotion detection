To improve the accuracy of the GoEmotions dataset using a Random Forest and SVM (Support Vector Machine) model, we can follow these steps:

1. **Load and preprocess the dataset**: The GoEmotions dataset contains text data labeled with emotions. We need to preprocess the text by tokenizing, removing stopwords, and converting the text into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.

2. **Train a Random Forest model**: Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that can handle high-dimensional data and is robust to overfitting.

3. **Train an SVM model**: SVM is effective for text classification tasks, especially when combined with TF-IDF or word embeddings.

4. **Combine the models**: We can use ensemble techniques like stacking or voting to combine the predictions of both models to improve accuracy.

5. **Evaluate the model**: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance.

Hereâ€™s the complete code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier

# Load the GoEmotions dataset
# Assuming the dataset is in a CSV file with 'text' and 'emotion' columns
df = pd.read_csv('goemotions.csv')

# Preprocessing
X = df['text']
y = df['emotion']

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# TF-IDF Vectorization
tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=5000, stop_words='english')
X_train_tfidf = tfidf.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_tfidf = tfidf.transform(X_test)

# Random Forest Model
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_model.fit(X_train_tfidf, y_train)
rf_pred = rf_model.predict(X_test_tfidf)
print("Random Forest Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, rf_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, rf_pred))

# SVM Model
svm_model = SVC(kernel='linear', probability=True, random_state=42)
svm_model.fit(X_train_tfidf, y_train)
svm_pred = svm_model.predict(X_test_tfidf)
print("SVM Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, svm_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, svm_pred))

# Ensemble Model (Voting Classifier)
ensemble_model = VotingClassifier(estimators=[
    ('rf', rf_model),
    ('svm', svm_model)
], voting='soft')

ensemble_model.fit(X_train_tfidf, y_train)
ensemble_pred = ensemble_model.predict(X_test_tfidf)
print("Ensemble Model Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, ensemble_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, ensemble_pred))
```

### Explanation:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - The dataset is loaded from a CSV file.
   - The text data is separated from the labels.
   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets.

2. **TF-IDF Vectorization**:
   - The text data is converted into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.

3. **Random Forest Model**:
   - A Random Forest classifier is trained on the TF-IDF transformed data.

4. **SVM Model**:
   - An SVM classifier with a linear kernel is trained on the same data.

5. **Ensemble Model**:
   - A Voting Classifier is used to combine the predictions of the Random Forest and SVM models. The `voting='soft'` option uses the predicted probabilities for voting, which often leads to better performance.

6. **Evaluation**:
   - The accuracy and classification report (precision, recall, F1-score) are printed for each model.

### Improving Accuracy:

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for both Random Forest and SVM.
- **Feature Engineering**: Experiment with different text vectorization techniques like word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT).
- **Data Augmentation**: Increase the size of the dataset using techniques like synonym replacement or back-translation.
- **Advanced Models**: Consider using deep learning models like LSTM, GRU, or Transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa) for better performance on text data.

### Example of Hyperparameter Tuning:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

# Hyperparameter tuning for Random Forest
param_grid_rf = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300],
    'max_depth': [None, 10, 20, 30],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10]
}

grid_search_rf = GridSearchCV(estimator=rf_model, param_grid=param_grid_rf, cv=3, scoring='accuracy')
grid_search_rf.fit(X_train_tfidf, y_train)
print("Best Parameters for Random Forest:", grid_search_rf.best_params_)

# Hyperparameter tuning for SVM
param_grid_svm = {
    'C': [0.1, 1, 10],
    'kernel': ['linear', 'rbf']
}

grid_search_svm = GridSearchCV(estimator=svm_model, param_grid=param_grid_svm, cv=3, scoring='accuracy')
grid_search_svm.fit(X_train_tfidf, y_train)
print("Best Parameters for SVM:", grid_search_svm.best_params_)
```

This code will help you find the best hyperparameters for both models, which can further improve the accuracy.
