The error you're encountering typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the batch size specified in your model or data loader and the actual size of the data being fed into the model. Here's how you can troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

---

### 1. **Check the Data Loader**
   - Ensure that the `batch_size` parameter in your data loader (e.g., `DataLoader` in PyTorch or `tf.data.Dataset` in TensorFlow) matches the expected batch size.
   - For example, if your model expects a batch size of 8, make sure your data loader is configured accordingly:
     ```python
     dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=8, shuffle=True)
     ```

---

### 2. **Verify the Input Data**
   - Check the size of the data being fed into the model. The error suggests that the model is receiving a batch of size 282 instead of 8.
   - Print the shape of the input data before passing it to the model:
     ```python
     for batch in dataloader:
         print(batch.shape)  # Check the shape of the batch
     ```
   - If the batch size is not 8, adjust your data loader or dataset accordingly.

---

### 3. **Check for Drop Last**
   - If your dataset size is not perfectly divisible by the batch size, the last batch might have a smaller size. To avoid this, you can set `drop_last=True` in your data loader:
     ```python
     dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=8, shuffle=True, drop_last=True)
     ```
   - This ensures that incomplete batches are dropped.

---

### 4. **Model Input Shape**
   - Ensure that your model's input layer is designed to handle the expected batch size. For example, if your model expects input of shape `(batch_size, channels, height, width)`, make sure the input data matches this shape.

---

### 5. **Debugging Steps**
   - If the issue persists, debug by manually checking the size of the data at each step:
     - Check the dataset size.
     - Check the batch size after loading.
     - Check the input size before passing it to the model.

### Example Fix in PyTorch
If you're using PyTorch, here's an example of how to ensure the batch size matches:
```python
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset
import torch

# Example dataset
data = torch.randn(282, 3, 32, 32)  # 282 samples, 3 channels, 32x32 images
labels = torch.randint(0, 10, (282,))  # 282 labels
dataset = TensorDataset(data, labels)

# DataLoader with batch size 8
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=8, shuffle=True, drop_last=True)

# Check batch sizes
for batch in dataloader:
    inputs, targets = batch
    print(inputs.shape)  # Should be (8, 3, 32, 32)
```

---

### Example Fix in TensorFlow
If you're using TensorFlow, ensure the batch size is consistent:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Example dataset
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((data, labels))
dataset = dataset.batch(8, drop_remainder=True)  # Ensure batch size is 8

# Check batch sizes
for batch in dataset:
    inputs, targets = batch
    print(inputs.shape)  # Should be (8, 3, 32, 32)
```

---

### 6. **Adjust Dataset Size**
   - If your dataset size (282) is not divisible by the batch size (8), consider:
     - Dropping the last incomplete batch (using `drop_last=True`).
     - Padding the dataset to make it divisible by the batch size.
     - Adjusting the batch size to a divisor of 282 (e.g., 6 or 9).
