Metrics are used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models. Depending on the type of problem (classification, regression, or clustering), different metrics are used. Below is a detailed explanation of the most commonly used metrics for **classification**, **regression**, and **clustering**.

---

## **1. Classification Metrics**

Classification problems involve predicting discrete labels (e.g., spam or not spam). The most common metrics are:

### **a. Accuracy**
- **Definition**: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
- **Formula**:
  \[
  \text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{True Positives (TP)} + \text{True Negatives (TN)}}{\text{TP} + \text{TN} + \text{False Positives (FP)} + \text{False Negatives (FN)}}
  \]
- **Use Case**: When the classes are balanced.
- **Limitation**: Not suitable for imbalanced datasets (e.g., 95% negative, 5% positive).

### **b. Precision**
- **Definition**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive instances to the total predicted positive instances.
- **Formula**:
  \[
  \text{Precision} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FP}}
  \]
- **Use Case**: When the cost of false positives is high (e.g., spam detection).

### **c. Recall (Sensitivity)**
- **Definition**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive instances to the total actual positive instances.
- **Formula**:
  \[
  \text{Recall} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FN}}
  \]
- **Use Case**: When the cost of false negatives is high (e.g., disease detection).

### **d. F1-Score**
- **Definition**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Formula**:
  \[
  \text{F1-Score} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
  \]
- **Use Case**: When you need a balance between precision and recall (e.g., imbalanced datasets).

### **e. ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under Curve)**
- **Definition**: Measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes at various thresholds.
- **ROC Curve**: Plots the True Positive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive Rate (FPR).
- **AUC**: The area under the ROC curve. A higher AUC indicates better performance.
- **Use Case**: For binary classification problems, especially when class distribution is imbalanced.

## **2. Regression Metrics**

Regression problems involve predicting continuous values (e.g., house prices). The most common metrics are:

### **a. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Definition**: The average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values.
- **Formula**:
  \[
  \text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \hat{y}_i|
  \]
- **Use Case**: When you want to measure the average magnitude of errors without considering direction.

### **b. Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Definition**: The average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values.
- **Formula**:
  \[
  \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
  \]
- **Use Case**: When large errors are particularly undesirable (penalizes outliers).

### **c. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **Definition**: The square root of MSE.
- **Formula**:
  \[
  \text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\text{MSE}}
  \]
- **Use Case**: Similar to MSE but in the same units as the target variable.

### **d. R² (R-Squared)**
- **Definition**: The proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
- **Formula**:
  \[
  R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})^2}
  \]
- **Use Case**: To measure how well the model explains the variability of the data.

## **3. Clustering Metrics**

Clustering problems involve grouping similar data points together. The most common metrics are:

### **a. Silhouette Score**
- **Definition**: Measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters.
- **Formula**:
  \[
  \text{Silhouette Score} = \frac{b - a}{\max(a, b)}
  \]
  - \(a\): Average distance between a sample and all other points in the same cluster.
  - \(b\): Average distance between a sample and all other points in the nearest cluster.
- **Range**: [-1, 1]
  - +1: Perfect clustering.
  - 0: Overlapping clusters.
  - -1: Incorrect clustering.
- **Use Case**: To evaluate the quality of clusters.

### **b. Davies-Bouldin Index**
- **Definition**: Measures the average similarity ratio of each cluster with the cluster that is most similar to it.
- **Formula**:
  \[
  \text{DB} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \max_{j \neq i} \left( \frac{S_i + S_j}{d(c_i, c_j)} \right)
  \]
  - \(S_i\): Average distance between each point in cluster \(i\) and the centroid of cluster \(i\).
  - \(d(c_i, c_j)\): Distance between centroids of clusters \(i\) and \(j\).
- **Use Case**: To evaluate the compactness and separation of clusters.
